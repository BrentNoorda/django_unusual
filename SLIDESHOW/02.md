About ME!

* Programming professionally for about 30 years (asm, pascal, C/C++, basic, mainframe, javascript, etc...)
* Used django back at version 0.something (it had some problems), then stopped for a while
(*django has changed a lot more than I have, so I'm likely doing things wrong*)
* Used and built some other python-based frameworks, so bringing some of that back to my django work
* Superhero Talent: Able to find things under dark, deep, murky water
