=========

* Been programming for about 35 years (asm, pascal, C/C++, basic, mainframe, javascript, etc...)
* Used django back at version 0.something (it had some problems), then stopped for a while
(*django has changed a lot more than I have, so I'm likely doing things wrong*)
* Used and built another python-based framework, so bringing some of that back to my django work
* Superhero Special Power: Able to find things under dark, deep, murky water
* More about me at the [Brent Noorda Brick Wall](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/41075/brentnoorda/index.html)
