API (very very briefly) <span style="float:right;">[&#x25C0;](26.md) [&#x25B2;](../README.md) [&#x25BA;](28.md)</span>
=========

Django is not just for delivering web pages. It's sensible for any HTTP call, for example, RESTFUL API's.

## Difference between an API call and a call for a web page?

Not much.  Usually it's still a GET or POST call (or DELETE, or PUT or replace, but, honestly, sheesh!)

You get to define the input types and return types. (Hint, JSON is a good choice. HTML is not the best choice.)

## Django minor problems

For web pages, django framework handles some things automatically:

* sessionid
* csrf on POSTs
* return content type

And another thing:

* API calls are often made from another web site to your web site (i.e. cross-site scripting)

## easy workarounds:

This short function in [api.py](https://github.com/BrentNoorda/django_unusual/blob/master/django_unusual/api.py) implements many of these features:

    @csrf_exempt
    @session_from_http_header_or_params
    @allow_cross_site
    def api_get_temperature(request):
        # called with a single parameter "city" which is the name of the city
        # if that's not "oakland" this will return an error

        try:
            getter = request.POST if request.POST else request.GET # i don't care if it's get or post
            city = getter.get('city','?')

            if city != 'oakland':
                ret = { 'code': 1, 'data': 'unknown city' }
            else:
                current_temperature = do_over( lambda x: lib.oakland_weather.get_current_oakland_weather(), logger=logger )
                ret = { 'code': 0,
                        'data': { 'temperature': current_temperature } }
        except Exception, err:
            django_unusual.models.Crash.record(request=request,label="ERROR ON api_get_temperature",details=unicode(err))
            ret = { 'code': 1, 'data': 'error unknown city' }

        return HttpResponse( json.dumps(ret,separators=(',',':')), mimetype='application/json' )

view the source for [api.py](https://github.com/BrentNoorda/django_unusual/blob/master/django_unusual/api.py) to see all those fancy functions

## try it

If you're running the server you can see the output directly in your browser (although as an API call it's expected to be called in some other way):

__[http://MY_IP_ADDRESS:8000/api/get_temperature?city=oakland](http://MY_IP_ADDRESS:8000/api/get_temperature?city=oakland)__ should return something like

    {"code":0,"data":{"temperature":50}}

__[http://MY_IP_ADDRESS:8000/api/get_temperature?city=austin](http://MY_IP_ADDRESS:8000/api/get_temperature?city=austin)__ should return something like

    {"code":1,"data":"unknown city"}

## API things to consider

* this API can be called from any program (e.g. AJAX, or an APP) - are you comfortable with the ways the data is sent around (e.g. session id)? maybe limit to HTTPS?
* do you need the cross-site and csrf stuff
* django can have a lot of middleware - is that too many layers for your quick API call
