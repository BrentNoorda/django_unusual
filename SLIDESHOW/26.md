command-line django utilities <span style="float:right;">[&#x25C0;](25.md) [&#x25B2;](../README.md) [&#x25BA;](27.md)</span>
=========

I often want to run django stuff from the command line, especially commands to access the ORM in a django-ish way (either locally or remotely on heroku).

Examples:

* cronnish tools
* complicated DB conversions
* data investigation
* back-door data entry

There's probably a right way to do this--I don't know what that is.

## Here's what I do:

Put a preamble something like this at the top of a py file:

    #### vvvvvvvvvv THIS SECTION SETS US UP WITHIN THE DJANGO ENVIRONMENT vvvvvvvvvv ####
    import os
    import sys
    django_unusual_dir = os.path.normpath(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))+os.sep+'..'+os.sep)
    sys.path.append(django_unusual_dir)
    os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = "django_unusual.settings"
    #### ^^^^^^^^^^ THIS SECTION SETS US UP WITHIN THE DJANGO ENVIRONMENT ^^^^^^^^^^ ####

Then anything else in that file has access to the full Django tools.

For example:

    from django_unusual.models import ColorTemp
    print "colortemp count = ",ColorTemp.objects.count()

## Example: [database_gc.py](https://github.com/BrentNoorda/django_unusual/blob/master/demos/database_gc.py)

[database_gc.py](https://github.com/BrentNoorda/django_unusual/blob/master/demos/database_gc.py) is meant to be run periodically to clean out old stuff in our database. Specifically:

* we'll remove crashes that haven't happened in a long while
* color/temperature choices that are much more than an hour old (since our samples only care about the recent hour of data, and we want the ID's to have plenty of room to roll over)

These kinds of things could be done periodically in many ways, but in this example we can run daily from the command line:

    # python demos/database_gc.py

for heroku users, it's just as easy to run this on the heroku server from a local command line:

    # heroky run python demos/database_gc.py
