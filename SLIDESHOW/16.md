the single/few-process problem <span style="float:right;">[&#x25C0;](15.md) [&#x25B2;](../README.md) [&#x25BA;](17.md)</span>
=========

When django is processing a request, this is what that python process might typically be doing:

1. .....waiting for a request.....
2. parsing the request
3. .....waiting for database IO (possibly just for request.session).....
4. .....waiting for disk I/O to read a file (e.g. template or cache).....
5. execute some python code, involves some DB work
6. .....waiting for database IO.....
7. execute more python code, maybe use an external API service
8. .....waiting for that external service.....
9. finish executing code, storing some data
10. .....waiting for DB I/O.....
11. return response
12. .....waiting for response socket.....
13. go back to step 1 to handle the next request

### I.E, the process spends a lot of time __...waiting...__ instead of doing

gevent, greenlet, & libevent combine to __make each web server support a lot more clients__ (seemingly) simultaneously with:

* (almost) no added complexity
* (almost) no added memory
* (almost) no extra resources (e.g. sockets)
* (almost) no client waiting
* (almost) no need for smart load-balancing
