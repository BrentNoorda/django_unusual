[many_simultaneous_color_choices.py](https://github.com/BrentNoorda/django_unusual/blob/master/demos/many_simultaneous_color_choices.py) simulates any number of simultaneous hits against [favorite_color_with_temperature.mako](https://github.com/BrentNoorda/django_unusual/blob/master/django_unusual/mako/examples/favorite_color_with_temperature.mako), which I used to get timings against a many process(fork) server, versus a 1-process greenlet server.

------------------------

### Many processes, no greenlets

Running 50 forks (i.e. processes), and simulating 50 simultaneous clients with __gunicorn django_unusual.wsgi -b 0.0.0.0:8000 -w 110__

* average response time ~ 11 seconds (it varied a lot)
* average memory use: ~1210 mB

(note1: some runs ran out of resources and had exceptions)

(note2: each fork only registered one color choice, because of how we're using global memory instead of a db)

------------------------

### One process, greenlets enabled (unlimited?)

Running 50 forks (i.e. processes), and simulating 50 simultaneous clients with __gunicorn django_unusual.wsgi -b 0.0.0.0:8000 -k gevent -w 1__

* average response time ~ 7 seconds
* average memory use: ~38 mB

(note that only one process is running, and all those color votes registered in the same global space in those mako variables of [favorite_color_with_temperature.mako](https://github.com/BrentNoorda/django_unusual/blob/master/django_unusual/mako/examples/favorite_color_with_temperature.mako))

------------------------

### results

In this particular example,  (real mileage may vary after) simplistic math says this server could support __31 times as many simultaneous connections, and faster, by using gevent__.

Of course real mileage may vary (I've seen published results much higher than this).

Caveats:

* may need to up # of files to support this many connections
* now database may be the limiting factor (see redis and memcached, etc...)
* and look out if you use globals.
