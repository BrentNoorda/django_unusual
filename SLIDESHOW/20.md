describe how I ran the server in different ways, and many_simultaneous_color_choices.py in many ways, and what numbers I got

PUT STUFF HERE

----------------------

Running 50 forks(i.e. processes), and simulating 50 simultaneous clients:

took about 16 seconds, used 1196MB memory
took about 10 seconds, used 1230MB memory
took about 8 seconds,  used 1204MB memory
took about 14 seconds, used 1216MB memory
took about 7 seconds,  used 1223MB memory

Average about 11 seconds, used about 1210MB memory

(some runs ran out of resources and had exceptions)

(note that each fork only registered one color choice, because of how we're using global memory instead of a db)

----------------------

Running 1 processes, and enabling greenlets (unlimited I think)

took about 8 seconds, used 33MB memory
took about 7 seconds, used 36MB memory
took about 7 seconds, used 36MB memory
took about 9 seconds, used 39MB memory
took about 7 seconds, used 38MB memory

Average about 7 seconds using about 38MB

(note that only one process is running, and all those color votes registered in the same global space in those mako variables of favorite_color_with_temperature.mako)


------------------------

In this particular example,  (real mileage may vary after) simplistic math says this server could support 31 times as many simultaneous connections, and faster, by using gevent.

Of course real mileage may vary (many published results are much higher than this).

Caveats: may need to up # of files to suppor this many connections, and now database may be the limiting factor (see redis and memcached, etc...)
