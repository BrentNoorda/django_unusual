=========

Mako, Jinja, Jinja2, whatever turns you on.

They're all pretty fast, so __don't worry too much__.

But __worry a little about performance__:

* for pages that are hit a lot or mush be super fast, do you want all that server processing?
* can some of the work go into the client and a static html be delivered (perhaps from CDN?)
