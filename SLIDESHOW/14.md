Final Thoughts on Template Engines <span style="float:right;">[&#x25C0;](13.md) [&#x25B2;](../README.md) [&#x25BA;](15.md)</span>
=========

Mako, Jinja, Jinja2, Django, whatever turns you on.

There's nothing really specially about the django template language that ties it to django **.

They're all pretty fast, so __don't worry too much__.

But __worry a little about performance__:

* on deployment do you have the caching done right?
* for pages that are hit a lot or mush be super fast, do you want all that server processing?
* can some of the work go into the client and a static html be delivered (perhaps from CDN?)


** caveat: django templates intrinsically understand the [Cross Site Request Forgery token](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/csrf/) <code>{% csrf_token %}</code> thingamabob. With other engines you may need to add that manually with something like this (mako example):

    <%!
        import django.middleware.csrf
    %>
       ... blah blah blah ...
       <form>
           <input type="hidden" name="csrfmiddlewaretoken" value="${django.middleware.csrf.get_token(request)}"/>
           ... blah blah blah ...
       </form>
       ... blah blah blah ...
