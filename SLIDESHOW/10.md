"<% ... %>" embedded blocks of python <span style="float:right;">[&#x25C0;](09.md) [&#x25B2;](../README.md) [&#x25BA;](11.md)</span>
=========

Any python code can be embedded between __<%...%>__ tags, and will execute within that spot of the html, using varibles, creating variables, causing havoc, etc...

For example, __mako_basics_favorite_color.mako__ contains this code block within the _%for_ loop mentioned previously:

    % for name,v in gColors.items():
        ... lots of code ...
        <%
            if (popular_color is None) or (gColors[popular_color]['votes'] < v['votes']):
                popular_color = name
        %>
        ... more code ...
    % endfor

It is common to have such a block near the top of the mako file, to evaluate the request object, verify user rights (maybe httpredirect and _return_ if there was a violation), and so on.

This is the code in __mako_basics_favorite_color.mako__ that initializes a variable and checks if the user entered a favorite color:

    <%
        popular_color = None

        previous_favorite = get_previous_favorite(request)

        if 'favorite' in request.GET:
            favorite_color = request.GET['favorite']
            gColors[favorite_color]['votes'] += 1    # this is bad code because of global stuff
            set_previous_favorite(request,favorite_color)
        else:
            favorite_color = None
    %>
