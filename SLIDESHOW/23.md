Logging crashes to the DB <span style="float:right;">[&#x25C0;](22.md) [&#x25B2;](../README.md) [&#x25BA;](24.md)</span>
=========

In [models.py](https://github.com/BrentNoorda/django_unusual/blob/master/django_unusual/models.py) I defined a __Crash__ table that I've been refining over my last few projects.

It has these primary features:

* logs crashes to the database, along with stack and requests and post data
* doesn't log too many crashes during any cascading crashocolypse event (only one-per-second, tops, and only first of those)
* attemps to put a signature on each crash, so similar crashes just count as multiples of the same crash
* helps to sort crashes on most-frequently occuring versus most-recent
* can be used anywhere in the code to log "crashy" stuff (even if not a true crash)
* recovers the DB to a working state after the crash (nice for PostgreSQL)

### 1) add Crash to our mako handling

In [views.py](https://github.com/BrentNoorda/django_unusual/blob/master/django_unusual/views.py) add this call to _Crash.record()_ in _show_mako_page()_

    except Exception, err:
        django_unusual.models.Crash.record(request=request,label="ERROR ON show_mako_page",details=unicode(err))

### 2) make some crashes happen

Run __[http://MY_IP_ADDRESS:8000/examples/favorite_color_with_temperature_and_db.mako](http://MY_IP_ADDRESS:8000/examples/favorite_color_with_temperature_and_db.mako)__ again until it has crashed at least a few times.

Also try a color I'm not expecting (e.g. "orange" as in [http://MY_IP_ADDRESS:8000/examples/favorite_color_with_temperature_and_db.mako?favorite=orange](http://MY_IP_ADDRESS:8000/examples/favorite_color_with_temperature_and_db.mako?favorite=orange)__

### 3) examine the crashes django admin

At [http://MY_IP_ADDRESS:8000/admin/django_unusual/crash/](http://MY_IP_ADDRESS:8000/admin/django_unusual/crash/) you can now:

* see which crashes are happening most recently
* see which crashes are happening most often
* drill down into the stacks and data at the time of the crash

### 4) fix the cause of the crashes

I'll leave this as an exercise or the reader :-)
