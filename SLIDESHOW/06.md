Mako Introduction <span style="float:right;">[&#x25C0;](05.md) [&#x25B2;](../README.md) [&#x25BA;](07.md)</span>
=========

[Mako](http://www.makotemplates.org/) is a very pythonic templating language. In it's most basic form it's just **python mixed into HTML**

### Why I like Mako versus Django's default templates:

* I already know Python and HTML. Mako just mushes them together (i.e. __don't make me learn anything new__)
* Full access to everything (no namby-pamby protections from causing harm)
* It doesn't prevent use of django templates (they're not mutually incompatible)

*P.S. I'm pretty sure most of whatever I say about Mako is also true abaout [Jinja2](http://www.pocoo.org/projects/jinja2/).*
