Mako Introduction <span style="float:right;">[&#x25C0;](05.md) [&#x25B2;](../README.md) [&#x25BA;](07.md)</span>
=========

[Mako](http://www.makotemplates.org/) is a very pythonic templating language. In it's most basic form it's just **let's add python to HTML**

Why I like Mako versus Django's default templates:

* It's very close to pure python embedded as-needed in HTML (at least the way I use it is).
I.E. I already know python and am not up to learning a new language
* Full access to everything (no namby-pamby protections from causing harm)
* It doesn't prevent use of django templates (they're not mutually incompatible)
