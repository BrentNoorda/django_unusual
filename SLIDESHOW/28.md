### Homebrew to make libevent and other package installation easer?

During discussion of [installing gevent](18.md), which I said was quite difficult (especially libevent), some said using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) makes this a lot easier. I hope so.

### RESTful API tools

While showing off [how I do API](27.md) we heard about some nice django REST frameworks: [Tastypie](http://tastypieapi.org/) and [Django REST framework](http://django-rest-framework.org/)

### gevent caveats

While discussing the issue that [some third-party tools that may not be gevent-aware](21.5.md), it was asked if the psycopg2 library is gevent-ready.

It looks like (see [here](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/advanced.html#support-to-coroutine-libraries) and [here](https://bitbucket.org/dvarrazzo/psycogreen/)) simple patches are available for psycopg2, but that even then you might want to do some connection pooling. Many blog entries have been written about the topic and I haven't investigated deeply yet.

Anecdote: For a different database (mysql) I once tested a almost-pure-C option versus a pure-python option. For a single connection the pure-C option was faster, but as long as there were even a few processes using the library concurrently then pure-python library, which automatically was greenlet-aware, was much much faster.
