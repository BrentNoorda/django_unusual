do_over - code that you expect to fail sometimes <span style="float:right;">[&#x25C0;](24.md) [&#x25B2;](../README.md) [&#x25BA;](26.md)</span>
=========

## the internet is unreliable

We rely so much now on services that are out of our control and expected to fail temporarily.

For example:

* __S3 calls are expected to fail frequently__, they're documented this way, and you should try again
* Most service APIs document failures
* Maybe someone accidentally tripped over an ethernet cable somewhere, and they'll plug it in in a second
* shit happens

## Helper: [do_over.py](https://github.com/BrentNoorda/django_unusual/blob/master/lib/do_over.py)

[do_over.py](https://github.com/BrentNoorda/django_unusual/blob/master/lib/do_over.py) provides a _do_over()_ method that I've found very helpful in situation where occasional failure is expected.

## Let's fix our weather example.

Remember that our call to get the weather is failing 20% of the time. The user shouldn't have to see this, we should just do a do-over.

There are a lot of options for _do_over()_, but we'll just look at a simple case:

[favorite_color_with_temperature_and_db.mako](https://github.com/BrentNoorda/django_unusual/blob/master/django_unusual/mako/examples/favorite_color_with_temperature_and_db.mako) was failing 20% of the time here:

    current_temperature = lib.oakland_weather.get_current_oakland_weather(fail_sometimes_on_purpose=True)

so we'll make [favorite_color_with_temperature_and_db_do_over.mako](https://github.com/BrentNoorda/django_unusual/blob/master/django_unusual/mako/examples/favorite_color_with_temperature_and_db_do_over.mako) and change that to:

    current_temperature = do_over( lambda x: lib.oakland_weather.get_current_oakland_weather(fail_sometimes_on_purpose=True) )

Try it: __[http://MY_IP_ADDRESS:8000/examples/favorite_color_with_temperature_and_db_do_over.mako](http://MY_IP_ADDRESS:8000/examples/favorite_color_with_temperature_and_db_do_over.mako)__

## WHAT ABOUT DB CALLS?
