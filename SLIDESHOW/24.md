I believe you should __crash early, crash often__.

* the sooner you find a crash, the sooner you can fix it
* it's better that you experience the crash than your users do

One way to do that is with [python's assert statement](http://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement).

### You can, and should, put asserts liberally throughout your code on things that you __JUST KNOW ARE TRUE__.

For example, if you know there's no way in hell the the temperature is going to ever be over 200 degrees, and your code is written based on that assumption:

    assert temperature <= 200

or if there's no way anyone in there right mind would call you with a null name parameter

    assert name is not None

or that the surname will never be None, or blank, or have spaces in it anywhere:

    assert (surname is not None) and (len(surname) != 0) and (-1 == surname.find(' '))

### "But those asserts add extra code I shouldn't need to execute"

Balderdash! On your server you'll be running with the "-o" flag which removes those lines from code entirely.

### "But I don't have time to write that extra code"

Harumph! You don't have time to debug the problem based on your assertation that turned out to be violoated, but that only results in a weird problem somewhere far down the line.

### "But those asserts mean the code follows a different path during debuggin that during execution"

Shut up and just do it!
