"% ...control code..." python code lines <span style="float:right;">[&#x25C0;](08.md) [&#x25B2;](../README.md) [&#x25BA;](10.md)</span>
=========

Any line whose first non-blank character is "%" is a single line of python control code.

Usually this is control code (e.g. _if_, _for_, etc...) and the block must end with a matching _% end.._ (e.g. _% endif_, _% endfor_, etc...)

[mako_basics_favorite_color.mako](https://github.com/BrentNoorda/django_unusual/blob/master/django_unusual/mako/examples/mako_basics_favorite_color.mako) has this _%if_ example:

    % if popular_color is not None:
        <p>The most popular color is ${ popular_color | h }</p>
    % endif

and this _% for_ code

    % for name,v in gColors.items():
        ... a bunch of code here that can use the "name" and "v" variables ...
    % endfor

*Why the need to end python blocks with, _% endif_, _% endfor_, etc...? That's a good question. I dunno. I guess the people arguing "this should look HTMLish" won out over the people arguing "this should look Pythonic".*
