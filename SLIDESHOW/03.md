Boring Setup Stuff
=========

Here's how I installed everything. It's boring. To play along you should probably skip this and just do the [short installation instructions](#short).

## long installation instructions

Install django and other packages, and init database:

    --- make django environment ---
    # mkdir django_unusual
    # cd django_unusual
    # virtualenv venv --distribute
    # source venv/bin/activate
    # pip install django
    --- install extra packages ---
    # pip install psycopg2
    # pip install psycopg2==2.4.5
    # pip install gunicorn==0.14.5
    # pip install gevent==0.13.8 (good luck with that!)
    --- initialize postgresql database (sqllite wouldn't be as demonstrative of gevent) ---
    # createuser -U postgres django_unusual -P
    Enter password for new role:
    Enter it again:
    Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
    Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) y
    Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n
    # createdb -U django_unusual -E utf8 -O django_unusual django_unusual -T template0

Create and initialize django project:

    --- create project ---
    # django-admin.py startproject django_unusual (weirder than this with venv, but ignore that)
    --- check that it runs ---
    # python manage.py runserver
    --- change database settings for postgresql ---
    in settings.py change ENGINE='django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2' and set NAME, USER, and PASSWORD to 'django_unusual'
    --- let django initialize the database ---
    python manage.py syncdb
    --- enable the admin server ---
    in urls.py uncomment "url(r'^admin/',..." and the two lines below '# Uncomment the next two lines...'
    in settings.py INSTALLED_APPS uncomment 'django.contrib.admin'

Now we have a default django server where _# python manage.py runserver_ only delivers _[http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin)_. Nothing interesting yet.

## short installation instructions

create an environment, grab everything in this presentation from github, and ignore all further installation instructions

    --- get all the code from github ---
    # git clone https://github.com/BrentNoorda/django_unusual.git
    --- set up virtualenv environment ---
    # cd django_unusual
    # virtualenv venv --distribute
    # source venv/bin/activate              -- I do this through # . ./setenv.sh
    --- install all the dependencies (good luck, some of the libevent stuff can be a problem) ---
    # pip install -r requirements.txt
