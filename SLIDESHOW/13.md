Other Mako Stuff (I don't use, yet) <span style="float:right;">[&#x25C0;](12.md) [&#x25B2;](../README.md) [&#x25BA;](14.md)</span>
=========

Mako has a bunch of other features that I haven't had enough spare brain cells to learn yet.

I won't explain them. __[read the Mako docs](http://docs.makotemplates.org/en/latest/)__

* defs (*looks real useful, I wish I'd noticed these before*)
* blocks
* namespaces
* inheritance
* filters, buffering, caching, and on and on...
